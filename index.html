     <h1>Binary Project</h1>
     <p>Computers use binary - the digits 0 and 1 - to store data.Binary code, code used in digital computers, based on a binary number system in which there are only two possible states, off and on, usually symbolized by 0 and 1.In binary code, each decimal number (0â€“9) is represented by a set of four binary digits, or bits. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc.A binary digit, or bit , is the smallest unit of data in computing.</p>
     <p>Now, you can ask for a decimal number. That has created an answer. It will solve it and give you the value of the number.</p>
